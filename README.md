## Tutorial / Installation
**NOTE:** If you already have an old custom/weapon-specific crosshair folder in `\tf\custom` delete it or rename it to `_VenomCrosshairsConfig`

1. Download the latest release found [here](https://github.com/hbivnm/Venom-Crosshairs/releases).
2. Extract the folder named `VenomCrosshairs` to a directory of your liking (that is NOT `\tf\custom`).
3. Run `VenomCrosshairs.exe` and customize your weapon-specific crosshair config.
4. Hit "Install/Update" to install config.
5. Set `cl_crosshair_file ""` in Team Fortress 2.

**NOTE:** Malwarebytes may report the executable as `MachineLearning/Anomalous.X%`, you will have to manually exclude the `VenomCrosshairs` folder to be able to use Venom Crosshairs alongside Malwarebytes.

# Original idea
Credit where it's due, the original idea of weapon-specific crosshairs in Team Fortress 2 (as far as I know) comes from a [teamfortress.tv thread](https://www.teamfortress.tv/30866/guide-weapon-specific-custom-crosshairs) by [joshuawn](https://www.teamfortress.tv/user/joshuawn).
